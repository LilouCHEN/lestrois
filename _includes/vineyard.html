                <h2>The Vineyard of Château Preuillac</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Located in the heart of the Médoc, 10 km to the north of Saint Estèphe in Lesparre Médoc, the vineyard of Château Preuillac covers 30 hectares in a single stretch. Facing due south, it enjoys outstanding exposure to the sun, providing ideal conditions for the grapes to ripen. </p>
              <p>50% of the vineyard is on clay-limestone and gravel, while one quarter is on excellent gravel soils and the remaining quarter is on sand-gravel. </p>
              <p>The vineyard is 30 years old on average, and is planted with Merlot (53%), Cabernet Sauvignon (45%) and Cabernet Franc (2%). The pruning system is guyot double. All the work on the vines is carried out by hand. The soils are hoed and no weedkillers are used.</p>
              <p>The vineyard is ploughed and cultivated in accordance with the principles of sustainable control: traps are installed throughout the vineyard to keep counts of insect pests and adapt treatments to just the right levels.</p>
              <p>Leaf stripping is carried out on the eastern side of the rows in mid-August to optimise air circulation around the grapes. Two weeks before harvesting, leaf-stripping is also carried out on the other side of the rows to combat outbreaks of grey rot.</p>
              <p>Systematic bud removal when the vines are pruned (3 buds per branch).</p>
              <p>To limit yields and enhance the quality of our wines, we carry out systematic removal of the base buds on all the vines.</p>
