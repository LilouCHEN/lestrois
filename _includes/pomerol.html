                        Pomerol lies immediately to the east and north-east of Libourne.
                        It is the smallest of all the major Bordeaux wine producing
                        appellations, with only 800 hectares under vine in Pomerol. This
                        miniscule area's wines define the Merlot grape at its very best.

                <li>
                        It stands on a gravel bank (a feature it shares with the
                        prestigious appellations of the MÃ©doc). The soils of the Pomerol
                        region are very diverse with a mixture of gravel, sand and clay
                        scattered across the plateau.

                        Pomerol is the home of the three most expensive wines in all of
                        Bordeaux, Petrus, Lafleur and Le Pin.
                </li>
                <li>
                        All Pomerol producers were required to make their wines at their
                        chateau, which must be located within the boundaries of the
                        appellation.

                <li>
                        Pomerol is exclusively a red wine with the only permitted grape
                        varieties for AOC wine being Merlot, Cabernet Franc (Bouchet),
                        Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec (Pressac). And its wines are known
                        to be of maximum elegance, richness, and complexity.
